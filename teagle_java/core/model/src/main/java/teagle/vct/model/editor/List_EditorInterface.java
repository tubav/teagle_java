/**
 * This declares the need for a generic list editor to receive the type of
 * objects that are in the list. It is a method and not a constructor because
 * these editors can only be instantiated by reflection (using newInstance())
 * and passing parameters there is problematic. This is an interface and not an
 * abstract class because, java lacking multiple inheritance, it would limit the
 * ability to derive an editor from two types, for example ListEditor and
 * InstantValidationEditor.
 * 
 * It's debatable whether this really is a real issue for editors. It is however
 * clearly an issue with configuration hierarchies. For instance if you have two
 * 'VirtualNode' and 'Router' abstract classes that resource creators are
 * expected to extend, creating a virtual router that runs in a virtual node is
 * not possible by defining a class that extends (subclasses) these two. This is
 * solvable either by having the two configurations as fields in a new class
 * (containment) or by defining VirtualNode and Router as interfaces. Still, in
 * many cases abstract classes and subclassing are enough.
 * 
 * The reason this template parameter needs to be passed is because inferring
 * the parameter of an ArrayList<Something> through reflection is to my
 * knowledge not possible.

/**
 * An essential implementation of document templates, primarily for html. This
 * is only used by the vct tool for generating the booking summary and
 * confirmation.
 * 
 * The syntax for templates is as simple as it gets: only the ${keyword}
 * construct is allowed, and such occurrences are substituted by calling the
 * render() method. No recursive rendering is done (for an html.template that
 * contains a list of sections that can themselves be generated from
 * section.html, you will have to define a ${sections} placeholder, then
 * generate all sections, concatenate them manually and render the html page
 * using the result. Rudimentary but not really a nuisance given the cost of
 * alternatives.
 * 
 * This code comes from the OMACO project, with perhaps very small changes.

/**
 * Base class of a generic rule definition for resources and connections. There
 * is a teagle.vct.library.RuleImpl that derives from this and that is very
 * similar to a Configuration (at least when looked at using reflection -- that
 * is it also has a static editor field and it only contains a set of primary
 * fields like a Configuration class). This split is needed because classes from
 * the model do not reference GUI (i.e. SWT) types. In principle there could be
 * another "concrete" Rule class that has an GWTEditor for example.
 * 
 * The meaning of the fields is still more or less not fixed, except that the
 * body_text contains the rule itself, and the others are metadata.
